        <h2>Javascript basics</h2>
        <h3>Console</h3>
        <p>
            In JavaScript, the console is the display for the code that you just wrote.  At nearly any point during your code, you can post to the console by using the following code like
            'console.log();'. You can make the console display anything like a word, letter, or number by entering that character in the parathensis.  One example would be running a code of:
            'console.log(5);' this will display'5' to the console.
        </p>

        <h3>Using the Comment Function</h3>
        <p>
            When addiding comments to your code, there are two options to access the comment function.  The first is '//', if you are using Visual studio it should automatically turn your text
            green.  Additionally, you can also use '/*' which will also turn your text green if using Visual Studio.  The one major difference between the two comment styles comes with using
            the '/*' function, when using that comment function you must close the comment with '*/' (See image).
        </p>

        <h3>Mathmatical Operators</h3>
        <p>
            Inside our program lines we can give our program mathmatical equtions and have the answer display through the console log function.  It is important to note that if you put a mathmatical
            equation in the parathensis of your console log statement, it will only display the answer not the entire equation.  There are 5 major mathmatical equations for JavaScript: Addition,
            Subtraction, Multiply, Divide, and Remainder which are expressed as so:
        </p>
        <table class="mytable">
            <tr>
                <th>Symbol</th>
                <th>Function</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>+</td>
                <td>Add</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>-</td>
                <td>Subtract</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>*</td>
                <td>Multiply</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>/</td>
                <td>Divide</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>%</td>
                <td>Remainder</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h3>Creating a String Series</h3>
        <p>
            A string is established by creating a console log and entering a word or phrase, either by using the ' ' or " " symbols.  We are able to combine two or more strings of code by 
            adding an addition operator (+) between two or more strings. One main function explained later is recalling previously established characters or variables that can be or have been
            identified by another string of code or by a user input. We are able to mix numbers and words together in one string compilation, by putting the number in quotes or by leaving out 
            of the quotes.  Another note to add, when adding a series of strings together make sure to leave space either at the begining or end inside the quotes to make sure the text spaces
            correctly.
        </p>
